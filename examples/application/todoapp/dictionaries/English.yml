      Good day!, welcome to this test page. This program is just to demonstrate
      most of the features offered by taktk.
      taktk, from from the work 'tak', meaning to order, and tk for tkinter
      for that it does, serves you in writting more organized, simple and
      readable code using sort of markup.
      The component language though it's appearance actually interpretes to
      python instructions telling taktk how to build the component.
      It is still in development, and I will be happy to hear of you issues
      at https://github.com/ken-morel/taktk/issues
